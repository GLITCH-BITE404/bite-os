## ◈ What makes it BITE

BITE-OS isn't a reskin. It ships things stock Arch and CachyOS simply don't have:

> ⚠️ **Developer Note:** Unlike basic rice builds, most of the system UI has been completely reprogrammed, optimized, and natively pre-riced from the ground up for zero-latency execution.

- **🦷 Dot-switch** — two *complete* desktops (`caelestia` + `ilyamiro`), swapped with **one keypress**. Every swap auto-backs-up your config, and a 30-second watchdog auto-reverts if anything breaks. You physically cannot get locked out.
- **⚙ Live GUI settings** — keybinds, language, weather, startup apps and dot-switching — all editable from an in-system panel. No text files. Configs recompile and reload instantly.
- **🛠 Self-repair** — a health check runs at every login and rebuilds a wiped config automatically. The OS fixes itself.
- **⬆ One-key update** — `SUPER+U` runs a full system update (kernel, apps, AUR, rice) that **keeps it BITE-OS** — branding is re-asserted on every upgrade, so it never decays into vanilla CachyOS.
- **⚡ Fast** — a full heavy glitch/DEDSEC rice that idles around **5% CPU** and holds **144 fps**. Performance is the whole point.
- **🌐 Keyless weather, glitch borders, animated everything** — and it still doesn't lag.

## ◈ Custom Keybinds Matrix

The system maps directly to these custom core inputs for elite navigation:

| Keybinding | Action | Execution Target |
|---|---|---|
| `SUPER + B` | **Hacker Aesthetic Overlay** | Triggers the "LARP" mode for full system cyber visual effects |
| `SUPER + T` | **Open Terminal** | Launches the pre-configured terminal environment instantly |
| `SUPER + Q` | **Close Window** | Safely terminates the active focused window |
| `SUPER + ALT + SPACE` | **Toggle Floating Mode** | Forces the active window into a floating layer |
| `SUPER + BACKSPACE` | **Hot-Swap to Ilyamiro** | Executes a rapid swap directly to the `ilyamiro` dots profile |
| `CTRL + SUPER + D` | **Hot-Swap to Caelestia** | Executes a rapid swap straight back to the `caelestia` dots profile |
| `SUPER + R` | **Reload Waybar** | Instantly recompiles and hot-reloads the Waybar panel |
| `SUPER + U` | **Update BITE-OS** | Full system update (kernel, apps, rice) with logs — stays BITE-OS |

## ◈ Download

> The ISO (~4.8 GB) is hosted off-GitHub due to file-size limits.

**➡ [Download BITE-OS 1.0 (dedsec)](https://archive.org/download/bite-os-1.0-x86_64_20260524/bite-os-1.0-x86_64.iso)**

`SHA256`: `5d8f789d3761317a804cc0eeb46947f7c0cd5d3aaff6d2f13d59794b91488add`

## ◈ Install

1. Flash the ISO to a USB (≥ 8 GB) with [Impression](https://apps.gnome.org/Impression/), [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/), or `dd`.
2. Boot it. The ISO comes up **straight into the BITE-OS installer** — a dedicated, bulletproof installer environment (no desktop to fight, nothing to crash).
3. Click through it: language → keyboard → disk → *your* username + password → **Install**.
4. Reboot into your own riced BITE-OS — the full pre-riced Hyprland desktop, exactly as shipped.

No terminal required, no desktop to pick — BITE-OS installs as **one opinionated, pre-riced Hyprland system**, offline (no internet needed during install).

## ◈ Updating

BITE-OS keeps itself current **and stays BITE-OS** — updates never revert it to vanilla CachyOS.

- Press **`SUPER + U`**, or launch **Update BITE-OS** from the app menu, or run **`bite-os-update`** in a terminal.
- It updates *everything* (kernel, apps, AUR, the rice), is **optional** (asks first, only acts if there's something to do), and **logs** every run to `~/.local/state/bite-os/`.

## ◈ Source

The core engineered logic — dot-switch + watchdog, self-repair, the live
settings engine, the rice vault — lives in **[`src/`](src/)**, readable and
auditable with no build step. See [`src/README.md`](src/README.md) for the map.

## ◈ Build it yourself

BITE-OS is assembled from this repo on an Arch / CachyOS host:

```bash
bash repo/build-repo.sh        # build the bite-os package + local repo
sudo pacman -S --needed archiso
sudo bash build-iso.sh         # build the ISO -> out/
```

> **Note:** the `bite-os` package payload (the rices, themes and tooling) is
> staged from a running BITE-OS system and is not committed here to keep the
> repo lean. The shipped ISO above is the ready-to-use build.
